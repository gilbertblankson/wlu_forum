	      <p>Bridget is a MSc candidate at LSE Cities, seeking and contemplating design strategies to modern urban challenges. She previously worked in the realm of architecture and urban design in Los Angeles after finishing an undergraduate degree in urbanism at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia.</p>
	      <p>At Walulel, Bridget saw an opportunity to experience London and its urban design from a quantitative perspective whilst putting into practice the knowledge gained on her Masters.</p>
	      <p>Not many people know that Bridget’s first loves are football and dogs and she is patiently waiting for the day that her dogs learn to play football (her own words!).</p>
	      <p>Bridget is under the illusion she was hired for her intimate knowledge of urban design principles. In reality we had to hire her because we were not going to be the team that passed up on having someone so hopeful that dogs will master the art of football.</p>
	      <p>Bridget in three words: <b>Outgoing, Efficient, Inquisitive.</b></p>
